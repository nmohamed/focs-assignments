## I. Formal Proofs

Use the rules of inference from class (reprinted below) to construct formal, numbered proofs of the following:

### 1. 

Assuming _p -> q_ and _p -> r_, prove _p -> (q AND r)_

1. p -> q
2. p -> r
3. Have p
4. Modus Ponenes: By step 1, have q  
5. Modus Ponens: By step 2, have r
6. Conjunction: q, r -> q ∧ r
7. ∴ p -> q ∧ r

### 2.

Assuming _p -> (q OR r)_ and _p -> (q OR NOT r)_, prove _p -> q_

1. p -> q ∨ r
2. p -> q ∨ ¬r
3. Assume p
4. Modus Ponens: By step 1, have q ∨ r
5. Modus Ponens: By step 2, have q ∨ ¬r
6. Conjunction: q ∨ r, q ∨ ¬r -> (q ∨ r) ∧ (q ∨ ¬r)
7. Distributive: (q ∨ r) ∧ (q ∨ ¬r) -> (q ∨ (r ∧ ¬r))
8. Negate: (q ∨ (r ∧ ¬r)) -> q
9. ∴ p -> q

## II. Truth tables

Use a truth table to show the equivalence of the assumptions and conclusion from problem 1, above: 
Assuming _p -> q_ and _p -> r_, prove _p -> (q AND r)_


| p | q | r | q ∧ r | p -> q ∧ r |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F | F | F | F | T |
| F | F | T | F | T |
| F | T | F | F | T |

Tautology

### 5. [** challenge/optional] _(p <=> (q OR r)) -> ((NOT q) -> (p AND r))_



## IV. CNF

Transform the following formula into conjunctive normal form.  Show your steps.

_p OR (q AND ¬(r AND (s -> t)))_

* p OR (q AND NOT (r AND (s -> t)))
* p OR ((q AND ¬r) AND (q AND ¬(s -> t)))
* p OR ((q AND ¬r) AND (q AND ¬(¬p OR q )))
* p OR ((q AND ¬r) AND (q AND (p OR ¬q )))
* p OR ((q AND ¬r) AND ((q AND p) OR (q AND ¬q )))
* p OR ((q AND ¬r) AND ((q AND p) OR (q AND ¬q )))
* p OR ((q AND ¬r) AND (q AND p))
* (p OR (q AND ¬r)) AND (p OR (q AND p))
* ((p OR q) AND (p OR ¬r)) AND ((p OR q) AND (p OR p))
* ((p OR q) AND (p OR ¬r)) AND ((p OR q) AND p)
* ((p OR q) AND (p OR ¬r)) AND (p OR q)
* (p OR ¬r) AND (p OR q)

## V. Short certificate

Demonstrate that the formula in problem IV is satisfiable.  Explain whether you used a  "short certificate" or exhaustive enumeration to make this determination.

Short certificate - If p is true, it's satisfiable. Otherwise, it'll be satisfiable depending on the inputs of q, r, s, and t. It's satisfiable if q is true and if ¬(r AND (s -> t)) is true. But, since it'll pass if p is true, then it's satisfiable since you have at least one pass case.
